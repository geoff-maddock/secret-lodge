Big Picture:
- Didn't play through entirely, but set up two player game and walked through set up and initial play
- Noticed a number of issues that were hard to answer and took notes
- Player boards were not sized right
- Not much energy to the game - mostly due to how much there was to try, yet not a lot of clarity on where to start

Detailed Notes:
- There was too much to do, hard to grasp all rules

- Simplify the factories - maybe just re-design card.
- Make sure the factories are on the board - factory board or tiles

  - building occurs in first phase
  - there's a set of rules - based on location on board and relative location to other players and other buildings
- Clarify how to score points and what actors are for
- Remove elections / make optional?  Remove laws / make optional?  Play with just a market, and re-add this later
- Revamp actor abilities - need to make them all useful, and have both an instant ability and tap ability or persistent ability [IN] [TAP] [PER]
- Clarify what secrets are for - end of game scoring / "hit points" of lodge
- Move the occult track to a different location on your board?  Clarify how it works?  Tap an actor to advance an occultist?
