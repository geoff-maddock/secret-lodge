This is the stripped down set of all necessary rules to get started playing.

See the **GAME RULES** for any questions or details.
See the **CHEAT SHEET** for a very brief checklist of rules.

## GAME SETUP
- Place city board in middle of play area
- Place each trade card around the outside of the bard
- Each player selects a lodge board
- Each player is dealt three cards
- Two cards per player are dealt into the gallery area
- A first player is choosen randomly
- The last player begins drafting from the cards in the gallery to fill out their hand
  - Each player in reverse order selects a card, then a second round of drafting proceeds the same way
- Each player selects a grand master for their lodge and places it in the slot
- Each player randomly selects a secret society card and a secret plot card
    - Only they may look at the cards, and in general they will be placed face-down in front of the player until they need to be revealed as per the card instrutions
- Each player receives their initial resources as described on their lodge board
- The first season of the game begins

## SEASONS
Each season has three phases

# CONSOLIDATION
- Gain resources based on the state of your board
- Factories and cards that produce resources produce them now
- Pawns that can return, return to your lodge
- Actors untap

## CONSOLIDATION ACTIONS
- Factories produce resources
  - Roll one die for each worker in the factory and earn that total number of resources.
  - For each favor level, replace one die with a favor die.
  - For each zero, you can keep the worker in that factory for no additional cost

# MECHINATIONS
- Each player takes one available action on their turn, then player to their right and so on, until all players have passed, unless an ability cirucumvents this.
- Available actions depend on the lodge, actors, pawns, buildings and cards.
- All actions must be stated aloud and the applicable rule or text allowing the action must be stated.
- The first player to pass has the first option to place actors up for election, and for every time their seat comes up and play still continues, 
    they recieve a pawn vote from the supply.  (Early campaigners build support)

## MECHINATION ACTIONS
- Available actions depend on the lodge, actors, pawns, buildings and cards.
- Draw:  Spend an influence to draw a card from the deck, or spend two influence to draw a specific card from their own secrets.
- Level Up:  Spend the cost to raise the rank of their grand master.  This makes them harder to assasinate and more powerful in the endgame 
- Hire Pawns
  - Pawns can be added to a player's board for the cost specified.  You can hire as many pawns as you can afford to hire with one action.
  - Pawns include workers, toughs, invistigators, occultists
- Play Pawns
  - You can play a pawn from your conspiracy board to any location.  If there is an associated cost, pay that, although there may not be.  
    - Gain any relevant reward 
    - Pawn plays
      - Workers can be placed in open factory slots
      - Occultists can be placed in the outer ring of the astral circle
- Add a building
  - To add an additional building, pay the associated cost on your player board
  - Add another building token to the additional slots on your board.
- Build a Building
  - To build a building, pay the associated cost on your player board.
  - Place the building on a legal space in the city
- Tap an Actor
  - You can activate a power on an actor by tapping (turning sideways) and then gaining the relevant reward.  Tapped actors cannot be re-tapped unless another ability allows this.
- Play a card
  - You can play a card from your hand by paying the cost.  You then place it into your conspiracy, face up in front of you.  
    If there are any "on play" rewards, gain them.
- Pass your turn
  - When you have no other actions you wish to take during this phase, announce that you are passing.  If you are the first to pass, take the first player token.
  - You may place one of your actors up for election in any district where you have a hall.  Place one worker pawn there to represent the initial vote, and each additional round that play continues, place one more worker on your actor.

# RESOLUTION
- All actions occur at once 
- Elect new aldermen in each district, and winning player select new laws;  if a non-player actor is elected, retain the last law.
- Check if any secret plot has been unleashed
- Advance the astral signs

# SCORING
Here's a summary of all of the ways to gain power (victory points).
- Building buildings on the board (see value on board)
- Tapping powers of specific actors
- During Resolution:
  - 1 Power for each district that you control
- During Final Resolution:
  - Based on power scoring on your secret lodge and the cards you have in your conspiracy
  - Based on if and how you unleash your secret plot
