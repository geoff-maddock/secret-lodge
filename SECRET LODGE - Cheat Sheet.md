# SECRET LODGE 
## QUICK SETUP
This is the cheat sheet briefest set of rules to use during play.

## GAME SETUP
- Place city board in middle of play area
- Place each trade card around the outside of the bard
- Each player selects a lodge board
- Each player is dealt three cards
- Two cards per player are dealt into the gallery area
- A first player is choosen randomly
- The last player begins drafting from the cards in the gallery to fill out their hand
  - Each player in reverse order selects a card, then a second round of drafting proceeds the same way
- Each player selects a grand master for their lodge and places it in the slot
- Each player randomly selects a secret society card and a secret plot card
    - Only they may look at the cards, and in general they will be placed face-down in front of the player until they need to be revealed as per the card instrutions
- Each player receives their initial resources as described on their lodge board
- The first season of the game begins

## SEASONS
Each season has three phases

# CONSOLIDATION
- Gain resources based on the state of your board
- Factories and cards that produce resources produce them now
- Pawns that can return, return to your lodge
- Actors untap

# MECHINATIONS
- Each player takes one available action on their turn, then player to their right and so on, until all players have passed, unless an ability cirucumvents this.
- Available actions depend on the lodge, actors, pawns, buildings and cards.
- All actions must be stated aloud and the applicable rule or text allowing the action must be stated.
- The first player to pass has the first option to place actors up for election, and for every time their seat comes up and play still continues, 
    they recieve a pawn vote from the supply.  (Early campaigners build support)

# RESOLUTION
- All actions occur at once 
- Elect new aldermen in each district, and winning player select new laws;  if a non-player actor is elected, retain the last law.
- Check if any secret plot has been unleashed
- Advance the astral signs

# ACTIONS
- Available actions depend on the lodge, actors, pawns, buildings and cards.
- Hire Pawns
  - Pawns can be added to a player's board for the cost specified.  You can hire as many pawns as you can afford to hire with one action.
  - Pawns include workers, toughs, invistigators, occultists
- Play Pawns
  - You can play a pawn from your conspiracy board to any location.  If there is an associated cost, pay that, although there may not be.  
    - Gain any relevant reward 
- Tap an Actor
  - You can activate a power on an actor by tapping (turning sideways) and then gaining the relevant reward.  Tapped actors cannot be re-tapped unless another ability allows this.
- Play a card
  - You can play a card from your hand by paying the cost.  You then place it into your conspiracy, face up in front of you.  If there are any "on play" rewards, gain them.
- Pass your turn
  - When you have no other actions you wish to take during this phase, announce that you are passing.  If you are the first to pass, take the first player token.
  - You may place one of your actors up for election in any district where you have a hall.  Place one worker pawn there to represent the initial vote, and each additional round that play continues, place one more worker on your actor.
