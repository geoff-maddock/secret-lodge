## PARTS & BOARDS

### BOARDS & LOCATIONS

#### City Board
The city board is where real-world action occurs in the game, and represents the the fictional steam-era "London" that is the game's setting.   The city is made up of **five different districts**: *North, East, South, West* and *Central*, and each contains **six hex-shaped neighborhoods** that in turn contain **six triangular spaces**.   Each district has a space for the currently elected **alderman**.  They set some rules for that district while the remain elected..  Around the outside of the city is the **power track** that keeps track of the points awarded to each lodge.   Each player has a pawn on the power track, basically "points" earned for different actions of power. In the final hour, the secret societies do battle and many more points can be scored.

#### Astral Track?
A depiction of each of the astral symbols and their state of favor or disfavor/alignment?
Work in progress, as this may be simpler or more complex.
Tokens or pointers on this represents the current astral signs in favor
One of eight signs are either in favor, disfavor or neutral
They change with each season?
Different cards, lodges and secret societies gain extra benefit based on these
Occultists can influence these through actions?

#### Lodge / Guild board
This is an alternative idea where the lodges are seperate from players, and players are conspiracies that are using/manipulating lodges and guilds.  The actors each player have determine how they can work within each lodge or guild.
This board/track shows the relative favor or disfavor of each lodge, plus number of free workers in each, shows the current head of each lodge,  other resources?

#### Player Board / Lodge Board
This board is where an individual player controls the inner workings of their secret lodge.
The lodge board has several special spaces, and other than the lodge name, everything can be configured about the set-up for each lodge
##### Grand Master
Any actor can be placed as the grand master of your lodge, and their attributes are considered the attributes of your lodge
##### Plot 
This is a pair of cards, played at the beginning of the game and is played face down in it's own space.  One card describes your secret society, their associations (which may be visible), and the other is your plot.  It has specific slots visible on the back that must be filled with resources, but the exact number and type are only known to the player.  
##### Power levels
These are sliders or pools on your board or possibly on your secret society card.  Not sure if this may work better like this or as resources.  Possible powers:  
Influence (behind the scenes), Occult (magic power), Popularity (public)
##### Insignia
This is the symbol for your lodge / type of pawn you have?
##### Vault
This is where the players current resources are stored and can be spent from
##### Secrets
This is a face down pile of cards that represent the secrets of the lodge.  In order to play certain cards you may have to add to the secrets pile.  Other players can investigate your secrets to unveil your plot.  These cards can be used as instants and in the final hour.
##### Pawns and Buildings
Each lodge has potential pawns and buildings they can raise under their control.   Once they are in play, they will grant the player power, income or resources, but they will cost resources or workers to put into play.
	
#### Conspiracy
Your hand of cards.  These can be played during the action phase if you can pay their cost and you have at least one lodge hall per actor in play.

## Brainstorming Notes
Each conspiracy must gather resources, draw actors into their conspiracy and put them into places of power to enact their secret plots.

Questions/Options
Are players un-named conspiracies?  
Are they lodges that are the "front" for a conspiracy?  
The lodge has influence in different guilds, trades, districts, etc?

Idea 
Based on each district and what factories are there, different resources are produced
Then as actions, based on bidding of player actors with levels of influence, they can collect the resources produced in that district OR neighborhood.  Special cards will give other players the ability to swoop in and collect resources, but may make it harder for them to take them in the future

Game #idea board game RPG that has session and campain elements with "innocent" npc types, guilds who control their lives, then secret societies (think rosecucians, masons, satansist, enlightened) who work on yet another . everybody has goals - collect timber and trade for food, rough up an occultist, investigate a factory - but also a plot that your secret society is working towards.

Cards can be added to secrets pile and removed as items.  Remaining cards help cabal
points, so that even mundane players an win, a guild can win, a conspiracy can win OR everybody might die in the balance and everybody loses

six rounds
unlimited turns using engine building
plus drafted cards that have multiple meanings
secret objectives
guild objectives and actions
commerce
magic
plague, famine, invaders
relics

Tasks are objectives for players.  If they succeed, they improve their standing? 
Or get an item into their secrets deck?   Characters have tasks built in?  Or there is a task?
Draw a task and if you can complete it, you get the reward.  If you can't, you must spend something to keep it or discard with an energy.

Plots: if unleashed it becomes the final turn and a grand battle occurs as every player gets one turn to act and resolve their conspiracy.  Only players with plots can take turns in the grant battle

Use magic, ingots, flesh and wool to build a secret golem or champion for your conspiracy, when activated has vast power and influence and victory points.

Resources: ingots, wool, gold, phlogiston, aether, bread, glass, brick, timber

Your conspiracy/chars can take one of several actions.  Manage work, move pawns, enter politics, build plot, build factory, rally influence, bolster lodge?

certain rituals can change the alignment of the planets to create constellations that are helpful for certain lodges or for certain plots

can claim things from the guild based on your ranking in the guild/lodge?

Resource types: pawns, coin, energy, material, occult, artifact

Lodge (your mat?), Guild (on board location?), Mill (on board production?), Cohort (your active characters in play), Conspiracy (your hand?), Astral Signs (sigils that are associated with different guilds and secret societies)

when you spend the influence of a lodge, if you do something positive, it returns to the pool.  if you do something negative or selfish, it is lost / the lodges favor goes down

Two sided building tokens, one for active o e for shut down

Toughs count for two workers

Secret societies: rod of hermes

 - [ ] Suspicion cards You can use a power from your secrets deck but it lets other players unfurl your conspiracy.

Suspicion cards You can use a power from your secrets deck but it lets other players unfurl your conspiracy.

#### Early ideas
- Lodges are public societes with affiliates to trades and cabals
- Trades relate to the players and the board
- Cabals are secret organizations of power
- Token types:  resources, workers, occult
- Resources are defined by the location on the board and can be collected by workers, lodges, politicans or other card/actions
- Playing an actors card into your secrets pile allows you to benefit if they come to power, or as a reaction by an opponants investigator
- You play to advance your lodge by bringing actors into your cabal
- At the end of each act/season (6 total) there is an election of aldermen for each district
- Each player has tokens or cards it can use to influence an election or other players votes
- Play deck contains actors and items
- Cabal deck contains cards that match each cabal (oh?)
- Lodge deck contains cards that match each lodge (oh?)
- Trial deck contains tasks that the player can accomplish to then alter the favored signs or recieve another benefit
