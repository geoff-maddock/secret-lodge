## PARTS & BOARDS

### DICE
Dice are used to add randomness to certain parts of the game, and are handled with wet erase dice created with different face sets
In most cases, the standard die is rolled.  In a negative situation the disfavor die is rolled, in a favorable situation, the favor die is rolled.

Faces | Type | Color
------|------|------
Standard Dice | 00 11 22 | Black
Favor Dice    | 11 12 22 | Green
Disfavor Dice | 00 01 11 | Red

### BOARDS & LOCATIONS

#### City Board
The city board is where real-world action occurs in the game, and represents the the fictional steam-era "London" that is the game's setting.   The city is made up of **five different districts**: *North, East, South, West* and *Central*, and each contains **four borroughs** that in turn contain **seven hexagonal spaces**.   Around the outside of the city is the **power track** that keeps track of the overall power of each lodge in the city.  Each lodge has a pawn on the power track (basically "victory points" earned for different actions that increase the lodge's power). In the final hour, the secret societies clash, unleash their secret plots and only one is left standing.

##### How will locations / empty space play into the game? #####
Building near the city center (+1 Iron or +1 Wood) or the center of a borrough (+1 Coin) is more expensive, but the more you expand the more power you gain.   Being the dominant lodge in a district gives you victory points.   Building apart allows you to effect more districts.   Building near an opponent requires that you pay them a tarrif.   There are also ten (10) unique locations that can be added to the game based on cards that have their own related actions.    Museum, Chapel, Stables, Constable, Tavern, Morgue, Speakeasy, Brothel, Dungeon, Blackmarket.

#### Astral Track
The astral track is a circular depiction of each of the eight astral signs and their state of favor or disfavor.  
The spirit token points to the sigil that is currently in favor.   They spirit moves forward any time favor grants a success, or when a pawn visits the tower.
Any actors who have a matching sign to the sign that is in favor are also said to be in favor.
Each lodge can perform rituals to increase their energy in any of the sigils, which leads to increased power each season.
Different cards, lodges and secret societies gain extra benefit based on which sigil is in favor.

#### Guild / Trade Factory boards 
Each guild / trade has it's own board on the play area, as well as factory spaces on the play board. 

Favor
- Each lodge has a different level of favor with each guild.
- Initially, each lodge places a token on the zero favor slot.
- Favor determines how well your workers will produce at the particular trade.  
- The favor number determines how many standard dice you can swap for favor dice during production.

Lodges can gain favor with a guild by:
- Playing an actor with the specified trade.
- Building a new factory location by paying the cost on the guild board
- Use the special ability of a card

Placing  Workers
- Players can place their workers in the factory to earn resources, which are earned in the production phase.
- If you have no favor with the guild you can place workers, but not if you have disfavor
- For each worker placed in the factory, one die is rolled, replacing one standard per favor, and the player collects that many of the specified resource during production.

#### Player Board / Lodge Board
This board is where an individual player controls the inner workings of their secret lodge.
The lodge board is divided into a few sections designated for different functions.

On the left is the lodge name, below that the grand master of the lodge is placed, and below
that is the tracker that indicates their mastery in the ranks of the secret society.  

In the center are the lodge resources and storehouse.   The upper section indicates the cost to place buildings, and what workers are gained during production
The storeohouse shows what resources they have available, each which are indicated by tracking pawns.

On the right is the secrets deck.  These are cards that represent secrets about different lodges and actors in the game and can be used as leverage.
You can gain them through investigations and occult activities and they are useful for gaining power and unleashing plots.

At the bottom is the lodge influence track.  Influence can be used to buy cards or change certain game results.

There are symbols and notes throughout that will help in indicating how each section can be activated.

##### Grand Master
Any actor can be placed as the grand master of your lodge, and their attributes are considered the attributes of your lodge.  The grand master can be protected by toughs or occultists, and their mastery can be leveled up in order to gain power and enact the plot.

##### Plot 
This is a pair of cards, dealt to each player at the beginning of the game and are played face down in front of the player. One card describes your secret society, their associations and the other is your plot.  It has specific slots visible on the back that must be filled with resources, but the exact number and type are only known to the player.  These determine some rules for scoring power at the end of the game.  They can be looked at at any time by the player holding them, but generally stay secret from other players.  They can be revealed by other player's investigators if the secrets pile is empty.

##### Grand Master Mastery Rank
This is the level within the secret society that your grand master has attained.  It can be increased by paying the cost.  [1 influence or 2 coins and one energy]
All secret plots require a certain rank.  The higher your rank, the more immune to investigation and assasination your grant master will be.  Each resolution phase you gain power equal to this rank.  If the grandmaster is assasinated, the new grandmaster starts with the lowest rank.

##### Insignia
This is the symbol for your lodge.  Each has an animal and a color.

##### Vault
This is where the players current resources are stored and can be spent from, a location on their lodge board.

##### Secrets
This is a face down pile of cards that represent the secrets of the lodge.  In order to play certain cards you may have to add to the secrets pile.  Other players can investigate your secrets to unveil your plot, secret society, and dispatch actors.   Some secrets can be removed from the pile and played.  These cards can be used to score power and victory in the final hour.  

##### Pawns and Buildings
Each lodge has potential pawns and buildings they can raise under their control.   Once they are in play, they will grant the player power, income or resources, but they will cost resources or workers to put into play. 

#### Hand
Your hand of cards.  These can be played during the action phase if you can pay their cost.

#### Conspiracy
The actors played face up in front of you.  These are powerful members of your lodge and of society.  They have abilities that can be used by your lodge, and can be promoted to grandmaster of the lodge when there is a vacancy.

### Pieces	

#### Pawns
These are pieces that can be moved around the board, and from the supply onto the city board.  All pawns can be involved in plots and elections.   Each pawn has specific places it can be used in order to cause an effect or use it's special power.  Pay the cost of the pawn to add it to play.
